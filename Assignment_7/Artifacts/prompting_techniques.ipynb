            "   - **Develop Bicycle Infrastructure**: Create dedicated bike lanes, bike-sharing programs, and secure bike parking to encourage cycling.\n",
            "   - **Promote Walking**: Improve pedestrian infrastructure, such as sidewalks, crosswalks, and pedestrian-only zones, to make walking safer and more appealing.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Implement Traffic Management Technologies**:\n",
            "   - **Smart Traffic Signals**: Use adaptive traffic signal systems that adjust in real-time based on traffic flow.\n",

            "\n",
            "5. **Congestion Pricing**:\n",
            "   - **Implement Congestion Charges**: Charge drivers a fee to enter high-traffic areas during peak hours to discourage unnecessary trips and promote alternative transportation.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Urban Planning and Zoning**:\n",
