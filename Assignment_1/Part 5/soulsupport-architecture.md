- Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and alerting

### Responsibilities:
- Real-time system monitoring
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Performance tracking and optimization

## Component Interactions

1. Users interact with the Client Layer, which communicates with the backend through the API Gateway.

2. The API Gateway authenticates requests and routes them to appropriate microservices.

3. Microservices process requests, interact with the Data Layer, and communicate with the AI and ML Layer as needed.

4. The AI and ML Layer provides real-time processing for natural language understanding, emotion detection, and response generation.

5. The Crisis Detection Service continuously monitors interactions, triggering alerts to the Integration Layer for emergency services if necessary.

6. The Analytics and Reporting Service aggregates data from various services to generate insights and reports.

7. The Integration Layer facilitates data exchange with external systems and partners.

8. The entire system is wrapped in the Security Layer, ensuring data protection and compliance.

9. DevOps and Infrastructure manage the deployment, scaling, and maintenance of all components.

10. The Monitoring and Logging system provides real-time visibility into the entire architecture.

This architecture ensures that SoulSupport can provide secure, scalable, and efficient mental health support while allowing for continuous improvement and integration with the broader healthcare ecosystem.
