# SoulSupport: Solving the Accessibility Crisis in Mental Health Care

## The Problem

The mental health space faces a critical and multifaceted challenge: **widespread inaccessibility to timely, affordable, and personalized care**. This problem manifests in several key areas:

1. **Shortage of Mental Health Professionals**
   - By 2025, the U.S. is projected to have a shortage of 250,000 mental health professionals (National Council for Mental Wellbeing, 2023).
   - Globally, there is an average of 13 mental health workers per 100,000 people (WHO, 2022).

2. **Long Wait Times**
   - The average wait time for a first therapy appointment in the U.S. is 25 days (National Council for Mental Wellbeing, 2022).
   - In some countries, wait times can extend to several months, exacerbating mental health conditions.

3. **High Costs**
   - The average cost of a therapy session in the U.S. ranges from $100 to $200 (GoodTherapy, 2023).
   - Many insurance plans offer limited mental health coverage, leaving patients with high out-of-pocket expenses.

4. **Geographical Barriers**
   - 80% of rural counties in the U.S. lack access to a psychiatrist (New American Economy, 2021).
   - In developing countries, the treatment gap for mental disorders can be as high as 90% (WHO, 2022).

5. **Stigma and Privacy Concerns**
   - 38% of people with mental health issues have delayed seeking help due to fear of judgment (SAMHSA, 2022).
   - Privacy concerns prevent many from seeking help, especially in small communities.

6. **Lack of 24/7 Support**
   - Mental health crises don't adhere to business hours, yet most traditional services are not available round-the-clock.
   - 85% of mental health crisis calls occur outside of typical 9-5 working hours (Crisis Text Line, 2023).
