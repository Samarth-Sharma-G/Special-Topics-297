# End-to-End LLMOps GenAI Application

## Overview
This project showcases the development and deployment of an end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based GenAI application. The application demonstrates the integration of LLMOps principles to build a production-ready AI system capable of delivering intelligent responses by combining retrieval capabilities and generative AI.

## Features
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Combines knowledge retrieval with generative AI for enhanced responses.
- **End-to-End Workflow:** Covers all stages, including data ingestion, model fine-tuning, system integration, deployment, and monitoring.
- **Scalable and Efficient:** Optimized for real-world usage with scalable architecture and efficient query handling.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive UI for users to interact with the GenAI system seamlessly.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Frameworks:** FastAPI, Streamlit
- **LLM:** OpenAI GPT-4 (or other fine-tuned models)
- **Database:** ChromaDB for vector search, DynamoDB for session management
- **Deployment:** Docker, AWS EC2
- **Monitoring:** Comet for experiment tracking

## Architecture
1. **Data Ingestion:** Data is preprocessed and stored in ChromaDB for efficient vector search.
2. **RAG Pipeline:**
   - Queries are matched with relevant documents using ChromaDB.
   - Retrieved documents are combined with the query and sent to the LLM for response generation.
3. **Session Management:** User interactions are tracked using DynamoDB to maintain context across sessions.
4. **Deployment:** The application is containerized with Docker and deployed on AWS for scalability and reliability.
5. **Monitoring:** Comet is used to track model performance and application usage.
