This expansion was driven by a desire for resources, territory, and influence.\n\nThe United States, under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, opposed Japan's expansionist policies and saw the need to protect its interests in the Pacific and Asia. As a result, the US began to take steps to counter Japan's aggression, including strengthening its naval presence in the Pacific and imposing economic sanctions on Japan.\n\nIn December 1941, Japan attacked the US military base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, drawing the United States fully into the war against Japan. The US then launched a series of offensives aimed at weakening Japan's ability to fight, culminating in the invasion of Japan's home islands in 1945.\n\nThe United States emerged from World War II as a superpower with vast economic and military power, while Japan was left severely damaged and occupied by US forces for several years before regaining its independence. The defeat of Japan and the end of World War II marked a significant turning point in world history and paved the way for a new era of global politics.
