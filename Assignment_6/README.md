# Nanogpt and "Textbooks are All You Need"

This repository contains implementations for two projects:

1. **Nanogpt from Scratch**:
   - Built using PyTorch, inspired by Andrej Karpathy's Nanogpt.
   - Modular code with debugging and training on a custom dataset (non-Shakespeare).
   - Includes a Colab notebook, Medium article, and a presentation.

2. **"Textbooks are All You Need" Case Study**:
   - Recreated using a smaller dataset on Colab Pro (A100 setup).
   - Covers end-to-end training, evaluation, and insights.
   - Artifacts include the Colab notebook, dataset, and presentation.
