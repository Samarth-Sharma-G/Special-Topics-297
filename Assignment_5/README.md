# Forecasting and Prediction Project

This repository contains completed Colab notebooks for forecasting and anomaly detection with TimeGPT, synthetic data generation with Tabular, and GNN-based tabular predictions using RelBench. Each notebook is fully executed and includes results for review.

## Project Contents

### 1. TimeGPT

Each notebook in this section demonstrates TimeGPT applied to various time series forecasting tasks:
- **Multivariate Forecasting**: Completed with example data.
- **Fine-Tuning with Custom Data**: Model fine-tuned on custom datasets for optimized forecasting.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Time series anomalies detected and visualized.
- **Energy Demand Forecasting**: Energy demand predictions with accurate results.
- **Bitcoin Price Prediction**: Bitcoin price forecasting with TimeGPT.

Each notebook contains step-by-step explanations of setup, training, and visualization.

### 2. Tabular

- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Successfully generated synthetic data for a real dataset.
- **Zero-Shot Inference**: Demonstrated inference on a Tabular model using zero-shot learning.

These notebooks showcase Tabular's capabilities in generating and inferring data.

### 3. RelBench with RDL

- **GNN-Based Model Training**: Trained a GNN-based model for tabular predictions using RelBench, including performance metrics.
